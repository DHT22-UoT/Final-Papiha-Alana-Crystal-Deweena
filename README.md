# Final-Papiha-Alana-Crystal-Deweena
Final Project with Papiha, Alana, Crystal and Deweena 

Task 1 - Get data from Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 API 

Task 2 – Use “wbstats" package to obtain data. 

Task 3 – Combine data to calculate the ratio of all types of COVID-19 cases (confirmed, recovered, death/mortality-rate) to the population (mortality rate = # of deaths in population per unit of time) 

Task 4 -  Create categories of countries based on their geolocation and socioeconomic indicators (e.g. by geographical region, by income, by economic inequality, by GINI index score, by education etc.). Use pre-defined thresholds to define categories whenever possible.

Task 5 - Compare the confirmed cases and mortality rates by select country categories. 

Task 6 - Pick strongest country level indicator of COVID mortality rate. 

Task 7 - Define country categories based on strongest country level indicator.

Task 8 - ANOVA to test whether the mean mortality rate between the different country categories based on your selected indicator is different. Use faceted plots/color groupings. Can use post-hoc tests if ANOVA null hypothesis is rejected i.e. Tukey's test.
