### **Main objective**

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Our task is to investigate data related to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and examine the mortality of COVID-19 in relation to socioeconomic factors. 


### **Data Source**

Data was retrieved from Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 API and the World Bank API. 

#### The World Bank

Row {data-height=350}
-------------------------------------------
### **World Bank API data**

```{r}
library(wbstats)
df <- wb_data(
  country = "all",
  indicator = "NY.GDP.MKTP.CD")
DT::datatable(df)
```

# Socioeconomic Factors 

We chose to evaluate the spread of COVID-29 in relation to a select number of socioeconomic factors. 

**Table 1:** Socioeconomic factors.

|Socioeconomic Factor|Measure|Categories|
  |:---:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
  |Education|Literacy Rate in females|
  |Income Level|Income in Dollars|Low income, Lower middle income, Upper   middle income, High income|
  |Population Density|Population per square kilometer|
  |Health|% of Government Expenditure|
  |Region|Geographical area|East Asia and Pacific, Europe and Central Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, Middle East and North Africa, North America, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa|
  |Income inequality|GINI Index|< 0.2 represents perfect income equality, 0.2–0.3 relative equality,0.3–0.4 adequate equality, 0.4–0.5 big income gap, and above 0.5 represents severe income gap|

Education - Literacy Rate in females 
Health - Percentage of Government Spending (GDP) spent on Health 
GINI index -

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
