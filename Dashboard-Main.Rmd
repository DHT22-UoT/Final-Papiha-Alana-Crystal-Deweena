### **Main objective**

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Our task is to investigate data related to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and examine the mortality of COVID-19 in relation to socioeconomic factors. 


### **Data Source**

Data was retrieved from Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 API and the World Bank API. 

#### The World Bank

### **Value**
```{r}

```

# Socioeconomic Factors 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
