# An Overview of COVID-19
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(flexdashboard)
```

### **Main objective**

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Our task is to investigate data related to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and examine the mortality of COVID-19 in relation to socioeconomic factors. 


### **Data Source**

Data was retrieved from Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 API and the World Bank API. 

#### The World Bank

Row {data-height=350}
-------------------------------------------
### **World Bank API data**
```{r}
library(wbstats)
df <- wb_data(
  country = "all",
  indicator = "NY.GDP.MKTP.CD")
DT::datatable(df)
```

# Socioeconomic Factors 

We chose to evaluate the spread of COVID-29 in relation to a select number of socioeconomic factors. 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
