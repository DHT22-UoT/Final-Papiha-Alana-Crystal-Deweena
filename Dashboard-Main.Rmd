### **World Bank API data**

```{r}
library(wbstats)
df <- wb_data(
  country = "all",

# Socioeconomic Factors 

We chose to evaluate the spread of COVID-29 in relation to a select number of socioeconomic factors. 

**Table 1:** Socioeconomic factors.

  |Income Level|Income in Dollars|Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, High income|
